VAN-OSTRAND DEWEY EQUATION OF CARBURIZING PROCESS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The purpose of the application

This application focuses on the calculation of total percentual carbon concentration under the surface of a low-carbon steel.
A derived version of Van-Ostrand Dewey Equation is used.This version is specificaly focused on dealing with 0,2%C steel.

2. Preconditions

 - the mathematical model applies for gas carburizing in vaccuum furnace
 - the temperature of a furnace can be set between 850 - 1000 *C
 - the maximum carbon concentration on the surface is wt. 1%
 - there are no restrictions on the time factor (except of 00:00:00)

3. Restrictions

 - the model does not deal with alloying elements
 - the model works only for constant carburizing temperature
 - the size-factor of material is not taken into consideration

4. Controls, Functions

By changing the values of dynamic parametres (Temperature, Time, Required Carbon Surface Concentration) using user-friendly
interactive elements, the user can set desirable conditions for a carburizing process. After clicking on "Carburize!" button,
the Measured Depth parameter can be changed. The final result can be seen at the right bottom corner of a window.

5. Input restrictions

Most of the controls which a user uses to change the parametres are already designed in the possibly most user-friendly way,
so an unskilled user can not do any harm to the programme.
Just in the case of measured depth values, there are some rules a user needs to follow:

a) Inserted numbers need to be non-negative.
b) Use the sign "," (comma) when inserting a decimal number.
c) Any other signs will cause the calculation to not be proceded - your previous result will stay displayed.
